 == Markers + Stacks ==
Define the layout of the yard. All lengths and positions are defined in milimeters for a marker and a stack.
A stack is a specific block on the terminal, and a marker is a place within that stack you can position a container.

Based upon this information we can draw a mark for the yard.

 == Stack entry == 
This is a container placed in a specific stack. A stack entry is placed by a stackcorrection or handling. 
A stack correction is a hard mutation done by someone in the backoffice. A handling is an actual activity done by a crane / stacker / carrier.
All stack entries with a put_mutation and without a pull mutation are currently in the yard.

 == handling == 
Alle movements of containers executed.

 == container location information ==
Shows a bit more information about where a container was or went to. A handling has a from and a to containerlocation information.

 == actions ==
Give information about the container which is transported.
